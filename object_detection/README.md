### Overview

The package allows to issue commands to the robot by presenting it specially designed cards.
While the first card allows to issue only one type of command (i.e. take a photo), the second one allows to issue four different commands.

You will need to print (no rescaling!) the *cards.pdf* file, cut out the cards and fold the 'operator' one.
Presenting the pattern to the robot's camera causes it to publish the command on */socialCardReader/command* topic.
